# Kratta
In order to launch program you have to have ROOT Cern and Geant4 softwares installed.
The following code depicts measurement system used in KRATTA (Krak√≥w Triple Telescope Array) experiment. Output is presented in sample_output.png file. 
With the help of Geant4 we get information of particle generated from target that moves through system - their angles and energies deposited on specific system elements.

In sample_output.png we can see respectively:
purple color - detector volumes,
dark yellow - the front wall of the detector housing,
white - scintillator system,
red disk - a target from which we generate protons of different energies,
blue lines - proton trajectory,
green lines - neutron trajectory,
red lines - path of motion of delta electrons.
